# web-audio-visualization
## Getting started
First you need to install the needed dependencies. Do `npm install` in both the project root and /client directories. Then, in the root, do `npm start`. This will start both the client's dev server and the backend. 

## Getting some visuals
To get some actual visualization to appear on the page, you need to enable Stereo Mix or some other way to get some audio input in your microphone channel.

Instructions for this can be found for example here:
